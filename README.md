# Auto Clicker
This code allows the user to either have the computer move the mouse automatically or move the mouse themselves. When the code is run, the user is prompted to choose between option 1 or 2. If the user chooses option 1, the computer will move the mouse to the coordinates (1000, 300) and click repeatedly for a total of 10000 times, with a delay of 0.01 seconds between each movement. If the user chooses option 2, the mouse will be clicked repeatedly for a total of 10000 times, with a delay of 0.01 seconds between each movement. The console window is also hidden during the execution of the code.
